##How did I prioritize my work (steps)
- Scheme of data flow
- React app with the ecosystem (redux, sagas, etc)
- Basic authorization flow
- More complex authorization flow to access tenants
- Redux structure to fetch subjects media
- Autoscroll
- Fetch more media with scroll
- Data fetching/rendering optimization

##How to run
```
  npm i
  npm run build
  npm install -g serve
  serve -s build
```

You will get information about local port in your terminal.

##What should be added:
* design
* unit tests
* e2e tests
